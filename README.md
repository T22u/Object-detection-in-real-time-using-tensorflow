# Object-detection-in-real-time-using-tensorflow
I worked on a problem of detecting objects captured by low resolution camera in real time.
Worked to achieve 99% precision within lesser time in multiple object detection using Single Shot Multibox Detector(SSD).
Implemented Convolutional Neural Network, Faster RCNN using Transfer learning ,Softmax Activation Function, Adam optimizer to perform object classification using Google Cloud Platform and the programming environment was Python with Tensorflow.
